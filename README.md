# UMigrate-PreTerm-Project
A small, pre-workterm project for the UMigrate app team using React Native. 

Instructions: 
Create a mobile app using Expo React Native that retrieves 5 facts about cats 
from the Cat API (https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts) and displays one cat 
fact at a time (just the text property of each fact is required). There should 
be a button that says “Next fact” that shows the next fact when pressed (cycle 
back to the first fact if already at the last fact).
